# Planned

- Better "empty" states
- Filtering issues table
- Logging and a log viewer in settings

# 1.2.4

### Fixed

- Code blocks now have correct contrast in dark and light modes (darker in light mode, lighter in dark mode)
- Theming issues for areas within TODO
- Disable auto version tagging. NPM method works, and given the action for checking the version, it is more flexible to just tag the commit manually

# 1.2.1 - 1.2.3

### Fixed

- Build action issues

# 1.2.0

### Added

- Dark, Light, System theme preference persists in database and can be toggled from Settings or View menu ([#10](https://github.com/barney-campbell/jira-helper/pull/10))
- Summary column in yesterday time tracking widget, widget now spans full dashboard width ([#12](https://github.com/barney-campbell/jira-helper/pull/12))
- Display version in settings, check git tags for updates

# 1.1.0

### Added

- Dashboard widget displaying time tracking from the previous working day
